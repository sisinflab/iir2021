# About IIR

The **Italian Information Retrieval** (**IIR**) **Workshop** was created in 2009 at the **European Summer School in Information Retrieval**.

The purpose of the IIR workshop has been to provide a meeting forum for stimulating and disseminating research in **Information Retrieval**, where early-stage researchers can network and discuss their research results in an informal way.
