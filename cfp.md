## **DUE TO SEVERAL REQUESTS, THE SUBMISSION DEADLINE IS EXTENDED TO JULY THE 2ND, 2021**

## Scope
The purpose of the Italian Information Retrieval Workshop (IIR) is to provide a meeting forum for stimulating and disseminating research in Information Retrieval, where Italian researchers (especially young ones) and researchers affiliated with Italian institutions can network and discuss their research results in an informal way.

IIR 2021 is the 11th edition of the Italian Information Retrieval Workshop. It will take place on September 13-15, 2021 at the [Department of Electrical and Information Engineering](http://deipoliba.azurewebsites.net/en/) of the [Polytechnic University of Bari](http://www.en.poliba.it/), Italy.

This edition of the Italian Information Retrieval Workshop will include a number of invited lectures from senior researchers.   

Participation to the IIR 2021 workshop will be free of charge. However, advance registration will be strictly required.

## Topics

IIR 2021 offers an opportunity to present and discuss both theoretical and empirical research. Relevant topics include, but are not restricted to:

- **Search and Ranking.** Research on core IR algorithmic topics, including IR at scale, covering topics such as:  
  - Queries and query analysis  
  - Web search, including link analysis, sponsored search, search advertising, adversarial search and spam, and vertical search  
  - Retrieval models and ranking, including diversity and aggregated search  
  - Efficiency and scalability  
  - Theoretical models and foundations of information retrieval and access

- **Future Directions.** Research with theoretical or empirical contributions on new technical or social aspects of IR, especially in more speculative directions or with emerging technologies, covering topics such as:
  - Novel approaches to IR
  - Ethics, economics, and politics
  - Applications of search to social good
  - IR with new devices, including wearable computing, neuroinformatics, sensors, Internet-of-Things, vehicles

- **Domain-Specific Applications.** Research focusing on domain-specific IR challenges, covering topics such as:  
  - Social search
  - Search in structured data including email search and entity search
  - Multimedia search
  - Education
  - Legal
  - Health, including genomics and bioinformatics
  - Academic search
  - Other domains such as digital libraries, enterprise, news search, app search, archival search

- **Content Analysis, Recommendation and Classification.** Research focusing on recommender systems, rich content representations and content analysis, covering topics such as:
  - Filtering and recommender systems
  - Document representation
  - Content analysis and information extraction, including summarization, text representation, readability, sentiment analysis, and opinion mining
  - Cross- and multilingual search
  - Clustering, classification, and topic models

- **Artificial Intelligence, Semantics, and Dialog.** Research bridging AI and IR, especially toward deep semantics and dialog with intelligent agents, covering topics such as:
  - Question answering
  - Conversational systems and retrieval, including spoken language interfaces, dialog management systems, and intelligent chat systems
  - Semantics and knowledge graphs
  - Deep learning for IR, embeddings, and agents

- **Human Factors and Interfaces.** Research into user-centric aspects of IR, including user interfaces, behavior modeling, privacy, and interactive systems, covering topics such as:
  - Mining and modeling search activity, including user and task models, click models, log analysis, behavioral analysis, and attention modeling
  - Interactive and personalized search
  - Collaborative search, social tagging and crowdsourcing
  - Information privacy and security

- **Evaluation.** Research that focuses on the measurement and evaluation of IR systems, covering topics such as:
  - User-centered evaluation methods, including measures of user experience and performance, user engagement and search task design
  - Test collections and evaluation metrics, including the development of new test collections
  - Eye-tracking and physiological approaches, such as fMRI
  - Evaluation of novel information access tasks and systems such as multi-turn information access
  - Statistical methods and reproducibility issues in information retrieval evaluation


## Submissions
Submissions of full research papers must be in English, in PDF format in the CEUR-WS single-column conference format available at [http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip).

Submission will be peer reviewed and accepted papers will appear in the CEUR workshop series. Papers may range from theoretical works to system descriptions.
We particularly encourage PhD students or Early-Stage Researchers to submit their research. We also welcome contributions from the industry and papers describing ongoing funded projects which may result useful to the IIR community.   
The conference language is English.

Authors are invited to submit one of the following types of contributions:
* Full original papers (10 pages, plus additional pages for references if needed)
* Short original papers (5 pages, plus additional pages for references if needed)
* Extended abstracts containing descriptions of ongoing projects or presenting already published results (up to 4 pages, plus additional pages for references if needed)

Submission will be through Easychair at [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iir2021](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iir2021).

**A Special Prize will be awarded to the Best Papers selected by the Steering Committee of IIR.**
